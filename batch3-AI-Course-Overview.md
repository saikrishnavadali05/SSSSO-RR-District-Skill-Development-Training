## 4. Program Duration & Teaching Model

### Total Duration

* **120 Hours (Overall Program)**

### Live Instructor Availability

* **72 hours of live instructor-led sessions**
* Conducted over **12 weekends**
* **3 hours on Saturday + 3 hours on Sunday**

Live teaching refers to **active instructor availability with live video**, explanations, interaction, and doubt resolution.

---

## 4.1 Interview-Oriented Teaching Approach

This program follows a **continuous interview-aligned teaching methodology** to ensure learners remain alert, engaged, and industry-aware throughout the course.

* **In every live session (Saturday and Sunday)**:

  * Previous **interview questions** related to the day’s topics will be discussed
  * Questions will be mapped to real interview expectations
* Wherever applicable, learners will be informed:

  * Which **companies** have asked similar questions
  * The type of role and expectation behind the question
* Trainers will explain:

  * Why the question is asked
  * What the interviewer is evaluating
  * How to structure a strong and clear answer

This approach ensures interview readiness is built **consistently throughout the course**, not treated as a separate activity at the end.

## 5. Mandatory Live Participation Policy

To maintain discipline, seriousness, and engagement:

* **Live camera ON is compulsory** for all live sessions
* Learners must be visibly present throughout the session
* Attendance is tracked based on live participation
* Repeated non-compliance may lead to disqualification

This policy applies for the **entire duration of the program** and is **non-negotiable**.
